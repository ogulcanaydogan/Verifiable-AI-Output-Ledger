# VAOL v0.1.0-rc1 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-19

## Highlights

1. Cryptographic evidence pipeline hardened for regulated audit use.
2. Deterministic auditor demo workflow now reproducible locally and in CI.
3. Production-oriented deployment profile added for Helm-based installs.

## Key Changes

### Security and Integrity

1. Added JWT/OIDC auth verification support (`HS256`, `RS256`, `ES256`) with tenant/subject claim binding.
2. Added strict profile checks in verifier for policy hash presence and Sigstore Rekor binding.
3. Added startup Merkle rebuild and checkpoint/root validation with fail-on-check controls.
4. Fixed proof persistence ordering so append succeeds even if proof index storage fails.
5. Added proof-by-id fallback reconstruction for legacy/proof-persistence-failure cases.

### Developer Experience

1. Fixed CLI key generation to persist both private and public keys.
2. Added regression tests for key persistence and proof persistence failure fallback.
3. Added `scripts/demo_auditor.sh` for accepted/denied request evidence, bundle verification, and tamper failure demonstration.
4. Added `make demo-auditor` target.

### CI/CD and Governance

1. Added CI integration job `Auditor Demo (Integration)` with artifact upload (`tmp/demo-auditor/**`).
2. Added SBOM generation and provenance workflow integration.
3. Added contributor/security/governance scaffolding (`SECURITY.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, PR template).

### Deployment

1. Added Helm production profile support (`profile.mode=production`) with mapped security defaults:
   - required auth
   - fail-closed policy mode
   - strict startup check behavior
   - Sigstore Rekor strict mode defaults in production profile
2. Added production deployment runbook:
   - `docs/deployment-production-profile.md`

## Breaking/Operational Notes

1. `vaol-server` defaults to `--auth-mode required` when run directly.
2. Docker Compose defaults to `--auth-mode disabled` for local bootstrap.
3. Offline/bare environments should explicitly set signer mode and key material.

## Verification Steps

1. Run: `go test ./...`
2. Run: `./scripts/demo_auditor.sh`
3. Confirm:
   - compliant request returns `201`
   - non-compliant request returns `403`
   - bundle verify passes for untampered bundle
   - bundle verify fails for tampered bundle
