# VAOL v0.2.26 — Writer Fencing Stabilization

## Summary

`v0.2.26` hardens HA write safety by introducing optional PostgreSQL writer fencing with deterministic required/best-effort modes.

## Added

1. Writer-fence store extension interfaces:
   1. `store.WriterFenceStore`
   2. `store.WriterFenceLease`
2. PostgreSQL advisory-lock lease implementation:
   1. `AcquireWriterFence(...)`
   2. idempotent `Release(...)`
3. New server runtime flags:
   1. `--writer-fence-mode` (`disabled|best-effort|required`)
   2. `--writer-fence-lock-id`
4. Helm support for writer fencing configuration.
5. Test coverage for writer-fence mode semantics and lock lease behavior.

## Backward Compatibility

1. No REST schema changes.
2. No protobuf/gRPC method or message changes.
3. Default mode remains `disabled`.

## Operational Notes

1. For regulated production deployments, set:
   1. `writerFenceMode=required`
   2. shared `writerFenceLockID` across all writer candidates.
2. Failover automation should treat required-mode lock acquisition failures as fail-closed startup.
